# Java-Database-Connectivity using JDBC

This project demonstrates how to connect a Java application to a database using JDBC. The process involves five key steps: registering the driver class, creating a connection, creating a statement, executing queries, and closing the connection. 

## Steps to Connect Java Application with MYSQL Database
   
    1.Register the Driver class
    2.Create connection
    3.Create statement
    4.Execute queries
    5.Close connection

### 1. Register the Driver Class
To register the driver class, use the following line of code:
